                The cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment can directly impact cancer progression and the efficacy of therapeutics. Understanding immune cell activity, the body's natural defense mechanism, in the vicinity of cancerous cells is essential for developing beneficial treatments. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the examination of gene expression on an individual cell basis, providing crucial information regarding both the disturbances in cell functioning caused by cancer and cell-cell communication in the tumor microenvironment. This novel technique generates large amounts of data, which require proper processing. Various tools exist to facilitate this processing but need to be organized to standardize the workflow from data wrangling to visualization, cell type identification, and analysis of changes in cellular activity, both from the standpoint of malignant cells and immune stromal cells that eliminate them. We aimed to develop a standardized pipeline that integrates multiple scRNA-seq tools for processing raw sequence data extracted from NCBI GEO, visualization of results, statistical analysis, and cell type identification. This pipeline leverages existing tools, such as Cellranger from 10X Genomics, Alevin, and Seurat, to cluster cells and identify cell types based on gene expression profiles. We successfully tested and validated the pipeline on several publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, resulting in clusters corresponding to distinct cell types. By determining the cell types and their respective frequencies in the tumor microenvironment across multiple cancers, this workflow will help quantify changes in gene expression related to cell-cell communication and identify possible therapeutic targets.

		    Identifying active transcriptional regulators (TRs) associating with cis-regulatory elements in the genome to regulate gene expression is a key task in gene regulation research. TR binding profiles from numerous public ChIP-seq data can be utilized for association analysis with query data for TR identification, as an alternative to DNA sequence motif analysis. However, integration of the massive ChIP-seq datasets has been a major challenge in such approaches. Here we present BARTweb, an interactive web server for identifying TRs whose genomic binding patterns associate with input genomic features, by leveraging over 13 000 public ChIP-seq datasets for human and mouse. Using an updated binding analysis for regulation of transcription (BART) algorithm, BARTweb can identify functional TRs that regulate a gene set, have a binding profile correlated with a ChIP-seq profile or are enriched in a genomic region set, without a priori information of the cell type. BARTweb can be a useful web server for performing functional analysis of gene regulation.

                Music genres organize music into collections by indicating similarities between different songs.
Many music streaming services such as Spotify have high incentives to automate the
classification process since they have an estimated 60,000 new songs uploaded onto their site
daily. Currently, many music streaming services leverage metadata such as acoustics and
emotional tone for genre classification because audio files are more useful than lyrics in terms of
classifying a song, due to the high dimensionality of the audio files and low dimensionality of
the lyrics. For this project, the objective is to classify songs into genres using song lyrics, and we
aim to see how well the various types of neural networks can perform in classifying the songs
into different genres using just lyrics.

                Frito-Lay potato chips are some of the most popular potato chips on the market, and many people purchase and consume these products every day. Batches of chips must meet certain standards to go to the market, which means determining the quality of batches while testing the production process is important to the producer. Through the creation and implementation of our color image classifier and grayscale image classifier, I was able to successfully classify potato chips as being either defective or non-defective with very high accuracy indicating that a model such as these could be a valuable asset to chip production lines.  Additionally, results proved that Grad-CAM is a viable method for determining the reason behind a defective chip.

                Lending money to strangers is inherently a risky decision. As a lender, you risk receiving late payments and being out of money for a short period of time, or worse, default by the borrower. There exists ways to mitigate lending risk by offering high interest rates or supplying loans with collateral terms. It is critical, therefore, that lenders understand the risk associated with offering a loan to a specific borrower, so that they can write adequate terms to reduce their exposure to risk. For this, attributes from 2,925,494 peer-to-peer loans provided through the LendingClub platform were used to predict loan non-payment (late past the grace period, or loan default). Using the ml package in pyspark, four models including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosted tree and linear support vector classification were constructed, and resulted Area Under the Curve of 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, and 0.95, respectively. Based on feature importance scores from the random forest classifier, it was evident that the borrower attribute that is most predictive of loan non-payment was FICO score.

                A Bayesian Approach to Diagnosing Breast Cancer

		Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, and it is the second leading death of women after lung cancer. Although this cancer affects so many people, it’s often misdiagnosed because of various reasons like negligence or testing errors, which can lead to potential severe health consequences. For this project, I would like to improve the uncertainty behind the diagnosis of breast tissues of a patient (malignant vs benign) given some or all of the patient’s measurement values such as radius, texture, smoothness, and concavity. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and these measurements originated from digitized imaging of the cell nuclei from biopsies of breast masses. The dataset consists of 30 predictor variables: the mean, standard error, and the “worst” (average of the largest three means) values of 10 features of the cell nucleus, and the outcome variable diagnosis. Then, the observations of the features were standardized using the mean and standard deviation, and the categorical variable, diagnosis, was transformed into a numeric variable. In addition, the dataset was split into 70% training set and 30% test set for model prediction purposes. Because of the small number of instances in this dataset with only 569 instances, Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo was used instead of variational inference for more precise samples. The goal of this project was to develop a sampling-based estimate for the posterior distributions of the variables and predictions in a main effects logistic regression model and two reduced models using the breast cancer dataset.

<h1>LIFE</h1>
<p>I was born in Guangdong, China. I moved to the US when I was 10, and have lived in Richmond, VA ever since. Some of my favorite things to do are singing, reading, exercising with Chloe Ting, and drinking bubble tea! My favorite bubble tea place in Richmond is <a href="https://www.brecotea.com/" target="_blank">BrecoTea Baking Studio</a>.</p>
<p>As you may have seen under Education, I withdrew from pursuing a Pharm.D. degree in 2021. There were a lot of struggles and uncertainties with changing my trajectory at that point of my life, but at the same time, I learned to be more determined and courageous through this change. One of the main contributors to this decision was my personal desire for a dynamic learning environment and challenges. Even before I started my undergraduate journey, I knew I was going into a pre-health career. I have never considered another option, and I was so focused on getting good grades in college and ignored exploring other potential interests. During my year in pharmacy school, I realized I was due for a change. It was difficult for me to imagine myself living a stagnant lifestyle and never stepping out of my comfort zone. Thus, I have embarked myself on a dynamic career path, and I am motivated to be a life-long learner. I am definitely a late game-changer, but I believe it is better to be late than never.</p>
<p>Below is a video of my trip to my hometown Taishan in the summer of 2018. I was not able to capture every corner of Taishan, but I hope this Vlog gives you an idea of what my hometown is like. It's nothing fancy, but it brings me back my childhood memories that are very dear to my heart. I have always been reminisicing the bits and pieces of my childhood after I have moved to the States. I was fairly nostalgic during this whole trip, but I also had the chance to explore many new places and met new friends. Honestly, I was a bit upset and frustrated to see the changes in my hometown within two years, but witnessing these changes during these past few weeks led me to realize that I was trapped in my childhood memories and yearned for every trace of my unchanged childhood in this town. Nevertheless, I am so proud of how much it changed and how the living standard of many were improved within a decade. I hope you enjoy this video, and I am looking forward to producing more Vlogs in the future.</p>
